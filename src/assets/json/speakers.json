I got to know why we should use the cloud platform. Being a ML enthusiast I would like to talk about why I was looking to purchase some high end machines, but cloud is making a lot of things easy for deployment purpose. Considering the beginner level developers & student community it will be perfect talk to complete the prerequisites for the next talks regarding the GCP platform or Anthos. As Mahaveer Muttha sir recomended me to share my journey of completing 250+ qwiklabs & 7 Coursera courses with the aspiring cloud developers. This will inspire them to start there journey into GCP & to prove them you can go into the clouds if you dedicate your time to cloud",

I wanna go beyond gender diversity, to this convex approach to tech with all the other aspects. What communities gave me is a perspective to look for opportunities around, taught me to learn new things coming on my way. Basically wanna say everything out here is offering you something, I take it to my vision & climb! I would also like to talk about my recent research on user experience & product design, srints, agile & scrum, giving a focus to Human Computer Interaction, focusing AI & ML, one of my blog published by REDX, founded by Prof. Ramesh Rasker (https://medium.com/@vidyangispatil/turning-noisy-stampedes-of-wari-into-cradles-of-innovation-87e30f2d9def). Today when I look back to what I was two years back, I feel awesome being a learner among those 180 mechanical brains, thinking out of the box, making a new way towards promoting and letting everyone know that if you're fascinating enough for tech, you'll see solutions with it in every aspect to work in. Thinking about why don't we keep learning the way we expect machines to!",

Tech communities like GDG's & WTM are also not reaching to those individuals in society. Being a social innovator & an active community member I trying to get those people on-board as the technology users. For that I have created some innovative solutions using technologies like Android & TensorFlow. I have developed new hearing aid which is costing 1% of the current cost. That innovation uses android platform to teach the students about the basics of phonetics & helps them to gain confidence for speaking. They can also practice their pronunciations using the same. This innovation has impacted a lot of deaf persons in my community & is helping them to learn at the right age. This uses Google API's in the backend. There is also the device for Blind people which overcomes the measure drawbacks of existing solutions by Google & Microsoft. For this I am using TensorFlow eager execution & my own dataset. This will help people to think about the whole new aspect of community & how they can contribute to rest of the humanity using the power of the technical tools in their hand. If the 20 year old kid can then they can surely do. This talk will be a lightning talk of 15-20 minutes but can explore the people to whole new horizons of technology. Some parts of my this journey will be recorded by GOOGLE's international branding team to publish from their official handles. I can really help the audience by sharing my whole technological journey for communities to find 'what's their MoonShot?'",
